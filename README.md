In order to get the audio files you must download and unzip them, these are too big to be tracked on github 
And thus we have just provided the link to first download them
Link:  https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database/download 
This should automatically download it

Now all the other files have already been put in the dataset, so using my "unzip_files.py" function in All_features/audio_files on the download should give you everything. And all you must do on line 37 of all_features.py located in All_Features is indicate where all the sound files are at, in your local machine. Then you can run the code!
